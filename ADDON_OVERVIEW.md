## Core Components

### 1. Audio Pipeline Manager (`audio_pipeline_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages the complete audio processing pipeline
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic library loading for obs-mic-filter
  - Filter management (add, remove, configure)
  - Real-time audio processing
  - Configuration persistence
  - Professional voice processing presets

### 2. PulseAudio Manager (`pulse_audio_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages PulseAudio virtual devices and audio routing
- **Features**:
  - Virtual microphone device creation
  - Audio device enumeration
  - Real-time audio streaming
  - Device monitoring and management

### 3. Main Service (`ha_mic_filter_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: Coordinates all components and provides HA integration
- **Features**:
  - Home Assistant configuration integration
  - Service lifecycle management
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Persistent settings storage

## Audio Processing Pipeline

The addon implements a professional audio processing chain:

1. **Input Capture**: Captures audio from physical microphone
2. **Noise Suppression**: RNNoise AI-powered background noise removal
3. **Gain Control**: Input level adjustment
4. **3-Band EQ**: Frequency response shaping
5. **Expander/Gate**: Background noise control during quiet periods
6. **Compressor**: Dynamic range control
7. **Limiter**: Clipping prevention
8. **Virtual Output**: Sends processed audio to virtual microphone

## Home Assistant Integration

### Configuration Tab
The addon integrates with Home Assistant's native configuration system:
- Device selection dropdowns
- Audio processing parameter controls
- Real-time parameter adjustment
- Persistent configuration storage
